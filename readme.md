LocationDataProcessor:

A crude processor to process location data files.

Due to the size of the files, they have not been uploaded to .git.

Also, to process the files, they currently need to be put into the Debug folder (otherwise the code will error).

With more time a proper setup would be used, but the processor is sufficient for current HackTrain 6 purposes.
